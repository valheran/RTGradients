Reactive Transport Gradients
A tool designed to take in arrays and calculate gradients and various other things related to trying to
use Reactive Transport Theories to quantify and navigate hydrothermal alteration systems

Basic outline of process
*Use EDS to determine reactive transport parameters and calculate Nprog (Reaction Progress Number) for the
 geochemical marker
*Create a 3D model of the Nprog distribution
